# Google homepage build

This repo contains the files supporting my build of Google homepage. This was completed as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This exercise was intended to help build my HTML and CSS skillz.

My main objectives, aside from getting the layout sorted, were to keep both the HTML and CSS as efficient as possible, and to also keep accessabilty in mind.
